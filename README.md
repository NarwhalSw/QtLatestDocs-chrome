# QtLatestDocs-chrome

If you are like me and use Qt a lot, you often find yourself typing QSomehting class names in chrome address bar, looking for Qt's awesome documentation.

This works great, but there's one downside: Google often lists outdated version of the docs first. Instead of crawling through search result, you can now click on the icon that will appear every time you are looking at outdated Qt docs, and jump to the dev snapshot pages.
